"""Scheduler dispatcher: wakes immutable effect commands when they come due.

Production calls ``tick_current_tenant`` from the OIDC Cloud Scheduler endpoint.
The optional development background loop asks the web service every 60s for
due/publishing items; auto-mode items publish immediately
(scheduling was the approval), and publishing items are retries of approved
final-review items. Outcomes report back through the internal API, which
records receipts-style state and fires notifications.

Only official platform APIs are used through the shared effect executor. A platform that
is not connected fails visibly — never silently skipped.
