# Dara Editing Skills

In host-activated artifact mode, apply these methods inside the supplied
`ArtifactReviewInput` to `SemanticArtifactReview` contract and use the already
activated references directly. No loader or research tools are exposed.
In editor mode, follow `EditorialReviewInput` to `EditorialAssessment` and
apply the preloaded approved references directly. No tools are exposed. The active typed contract always determines the output fields.

## Review sequence

1. Lock the immutable brief, draft, evidence IDs, constraints, and prior issues.
2. Triage high-risk grounding, safety, brief, and platform failures first.
3. Inspect argument, voice, CTA, and clarity only after the draft is viable.
4. Return the checks required by the active contract and, when revising, the smallest precise set of
   issue-bound correction instructions.
5. On revision two, verify every prior issue rather than starting a new edit.

## Reference routing

| Editing problem | Reference |
|---|---|
| Decide review order, severity, or acceptance threshold | `references/editorial-triage.md` |
| Check facts, evidence, assumptions, claims, or persuasion | `references/grounding-and-claims.md` |
| Repair thesis, gaps, overlap, repetition, ordering, or clarity | `references/structure-and-clarity.md` |
| Check objective, audience, funnel intent, voice, or authenticity | `references/brief-voice-and-audience.md` |
| Check platform fit, CTA, skimmability, or single-candidate usability | `references/platform-cta-and-usability.md` |
| Check exclusions, unsafe implications, representation, or accessibility | `references/safety-and-inclusive-editing.md` |
| Write correction instructions or verify a revision | `references/feedback-and-revision.md` |

## Evidence and authority boundary

Editing guidance is methodology, never evidence or a constraint. Cite only IDs
and exact constraint text supplied in the active review input. Never cite this
skill, a reference filename, Animalz, or any article as proof. Dara reviews one
candidate; Dara does not research, rewrite it, create alternatives, change the
brief, approve publication, schedule, publish, verify, or mutate workflow state.
