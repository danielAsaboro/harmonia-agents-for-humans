# Temi Editorial Planning Skills

Use these methods inside the strict `EditorialPlannerInput` → `EditorialPlan`
contract. Harmonia activates this skill and its relevant references before
delegation. Use the supplied immutable planning snapshot directly; do not call
loader or read tools, which are not exposed to this specialist.

## Core sequence

1. Lock the approved strategy, snapshot identity, horizon, and capabilities.
2. Preserve each selected brief's strategic fields. Bind item evidence to this
   job's analysis using the snapshot's `sourceBinding`; cite at least one current
   moment or angle and only IDs in its `evidenceIds`.
3. Allocate supported channels and formats against capacity and commitments.
4. Sequence collision-free windows and production deadlines.
5. Score eligible items and select exactly one unblocked next item.
6. Critique the calendar for feasibility, coherence, and unsupported inference.

## Reference routing

| Planning task | Reference |
|---|---|
| Translate approved briefs into plan items | `references/strategy-to-editorial-plan.md` |
| Sequence windows and enforce cadence | `references/calendar-sequencing-and-cadence.md` |
| Plan capacity, dependencies, assets, and deadlines | `references/capacity-dependencies-and-deadlines.md` |
| Allocate supported channels, formats, and portfolio balance | `references/channel-format-and-portfolio-allocation.md` |
| Score priorities and select the next item | `references/priority-and-next-item-selection.md` |
| Critique or revise a plan after feedback | `references/replanning-and-calendar-critique.md` |

## Evidence and authority boundary

Skill guidance is method, never evidence. The approved strategy retains its
original evidence unchanged. Production items use the current job's host-bound
source evidence; an old brief's source IDs do not authorize a new job. Empty planning records mean
"none supplied," not permission to invent them. Temi never changes strategy,
writes copy, approves, mutates a calendar, schedules externally, publishes,
handles credentials, creates effects or receipts, or claims verification.
