# Harmonia A2UI Chat Console Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build a streaming, upload-capable, approval-safe A2UI Chat Console without adding Vercel AI SDK or Genkit.

**Architecture:** A typed NDJSON chat stream carries host events and A2UI operations. The official A2UI React renderer consumes only validated A2UI payloads, while trusted React components retain control of uploads, reconnection, and confirmations.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Zod, Strands Agents SDK, A2UI v0.9.1, DynamoDB, Cloud Storage, Vitest, Pytest.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-a2ui-chat-console-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Do not install or import Vercel AI SDK, AI Elements, or Genkit.
- Never expose raw hidden model reasoning.
- Agent-produced data cannot directly approve or execute an operation.
- Existing public chat, job, action, approval, receipt, and SQS contracts remain compatible.
- Production uploads must go directly to tenant-scoped Cloud Storage through resumable sessions.
- Mock mode must use the same validation and rendering contracts as real mode.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ChatStreamEvent`, `parseChatStreamEvent`, `HARMONIA_CATALOG_ID`, safe URL parsing, and catalog component schemas.

- [ ] Write tests that reject unknown events, raw reasoning fields, unsafe citation URLs, unknown component types, and malformed confirmation references.
- [ ] Run `npm test -- tests/a2uiContracts.test.ts` and verify the tests fail because the contracts do not exist.
- [ ] Implement the minimal Zod event and component contracts.
- [ ] Install the official A2UI React and web-core packages using pinned compatible versions.
- [ ] Run the focused test and verify it passes.
- [ ] Commit the protocol slice.

- [ ] Commit the attachment slice.

### Task 4: Durable stream and confirmations

**Files:**
