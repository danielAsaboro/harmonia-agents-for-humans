# Governed Resident Autonomy Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add a durable, tenant-scoped resident autonomy control plane with hourly Heartbeats, post-job Micro-reflections, nightly Dream Cycles, morning Wakeup Calls, bounded experiments, conservative automatic tuning, rollback, and a truthful operations view.

**Architecture:** DynamoDB owns immutable cycle identities, leases, evidence, agendas, experiments, and configuration revisions. EventBridge Scheduler only wakes a private ECS Fargate boundary; deterministic TypeScript policy and Python orchestration decide which independent arms may run, while Strands/Gemini receive sanitized typed inputs and never obtain scheduling, approval, budget, effect, or configuration-write authority. Existing precise scheduled-effect wakes and idempotent effect commands remain unchanged.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5, Zod 4, DynamoDB transactions, Next.js 16, React 19, Vitest 4, Python 3.14, Strands Agents SDK, pytest, ECS Fargate, SQS, EventBridge Scheduler.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-governed-resident-autonomy-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Runtime documentation distinguishes `implemented`, `configured`, `deployed`, and `evidenced`.
- No model may change code, prompts, agents, models, policies, approvals, budgets, credentials, permissions, tools, integrations, workflow stages, source-rights rules, or infrastructure.
- Automatic changes are limited to posting windows, format weights, topic-fatigue suppression, bounded retry/backoff values, and preferences among approved templates.
- Replay, fixture, mock, synthetic, unverified, and unauthorized evidence never qualifies for learning or promotion.
- Every cognitive arm reserves autonomy budget before invocation; paid-arm failure pauses that arm while free maintenance continues.
- Effect-bearing work continues through immutable commands, atomic claims, receipts, and independent verification.
- Resident schedules remain disabled locally and are not deployed or evidenced by this plan.
- Existing unrelated untracked files under `.superpowers/`, `public/architecture/`, and `public/brand/` remain untouched.

- Create: `src/lib/residentAutonomy/policy.ts`
- Test: `tests/residentAutonomyContracts.test.ts`
- Test: `tests/residentAutonomyPolicy.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: strict Zod schemas and types for `AutonomyCycle`, `Observation`, `Reflection`, `Hypothesis`, `Experiment`, `ConfigurationRevision`, `Agenda`, `AgendaItem`, `AttentionRequest`; `eligibleEvolutionEvidence(record)`; `classifyAgendaAuthority(item)`; `validateAutoTuneCandidate(candidate, policy)`.
- Consumes: no storage or model dependencies.

- [ ] Write failing tests that reject unknown fields, invalid cycle transitions, non-scoped records, replay/fixture/mock evidence, protected tuning categories, multi-variable experiments, missing rollback pointers, and out-of-bounds retry/posting/weight candidates.
- [ ] Run `npx vitest run tests/residentAutonomyContracts.test.ts tests/residentAutonomyPolicy.test.ts` and confirm failure because the modules do not exist.
- [ ] Implement strict schemas with literal cycle states/types, typed failure classes, authority classes, evidence provenance, UTC timestamps plus workspace timezone, immutable experiment variable definitions, and explicit protected categories.
- [ ] Implement pure deterministic eligibility and bounds functions; protected candidates return `propose`, never `auto_tune`.
- [ ] Re-run focused tests and commit `feat: add resident autonomy contracts`.

### Task 2: Cycle Identity, Lease, Transition, and Recovery State Machine

**Files:**

- [ ] Run focused tests and observe RED or emulator skips only where the repository’s existing integration convention requires it.
